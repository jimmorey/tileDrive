obstacles thoughts
* available polygon counts....
* points (with flags) vs discs
    * flags: black  vs checkered (goal)
* external points imported vs tileDrive generated points
    * tileDrive points are more tricky (maybe add a drop command)
* minimal interface
    * no colours insert rainbow " after every polygon...
